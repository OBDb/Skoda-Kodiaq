    description: "The first-generation Škoda Kodiaq is a mid-size crossover SUV representing the Czech brand's first large SUV, named after the Alaskan Kodiak bear. Built on Volkswagen Group's MQB A2 platform shared with VW Tiguan Allspace and SEAT Tarraco, the Kodiaq offered five or seven-seat configurations. Measuring approximately 4.7 meters in length, it featured crystalline design elements inspired by Czech glass art in the headlights and taillights. Engine options included 1.4 TSI (125-150 HP) and 2.0 TSI (180-220 HP) petrol units, plus 2.0 TDI diesel variants (150-240 HP). Transmission options included 6-speed manual and 6/7-speed DSG dual-clutch, with front-wheel drive standard and all-wheel drive available on higher trims. The interior featured an 8-inch infotainment system with capacitive buttons (first in VW Group MQB), Virtual Cockpit option, and 'Simply Clever' features like door-edge protection and integrated umbrella. Variants included Scout (raised ground clearance), Sportline (black trim, sport seats), and RS performance model with 240 HP bi-turbo diesel. The Kodiaq GT coupe variant was sold only in China."

    description: "The facelifted first-generation Kodiaq launched in April 2021 introduced subtle but significant visual and functional updates. Exterior changes included a redesigned hood, more upright front grille, and slimmer LED headlights with optional matrix technology for improved aerodynamics. Bumpers were revised and a new roof-mounted spoiler enhanced efficiency. High-performance RS model received a 245 HP 2.0 TSI petrol engine replacing the previous bi-turbo diesel. New 20-inch polished wheels in metallic black with aero shields were exclusive to RS variants. The Kodiaq maintained its position as Škoda's flagship SUV with continued success in European and Asian markets, winning multiple awards including 'Best Family Car' accolades. Production of the first generation continued through 2024."
