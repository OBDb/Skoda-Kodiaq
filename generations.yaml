    description: "The first-generation Škoda Kodiaq represented a significant milestone for the Czech brand as its first large SUV, named after the Alaskan Kodiak bear (with the spelling altered to reflect Škoda's branding). Built on the Volkswagen Group's MQB platform shared with models like the Volkswagen Tiguan and SEAT Ateca, the Kodiaq offered five or seven-seat configurations, positioning it as a versatile family vehicle. Measuring approximately 4.7 meters in length, the Kodiaq featured distinctive styling with crystalline elements inspired by Czech crystal glass, particularly in the headlights and taillights. Engine options included 1.4 TSI and 2.0 TSI gasoline units and 1.6 TDI and 2.0 TDI diesel variants, with power outputs ranging from 125 to 190 horsepower in standard models. Transmission options included six-speed manual and seven-speed DSG dual-clutch automatic, with front-wheel drive standard on lower-powered variants and all-wheel drive available or standard on higher trims. The interior combined Škoda's practical approach with premium touches, featuring a central infotainment display up to 9.2 inches, an optional digital instrument cluster, and high-quality materials throughout. True to Škoda's 'Simply Clever' philosophy, the Kodiaq incorporated numerous practical features including door-edge protection that deploys automatically when opening the doors, an umbrella stored in the front door, and an ice scraper housed in the fuel filler cap. A facelift in 2021 brought updated exterior styling with a more upright grille, revised LED lighting, and interior refinements including enhanced technology. The performance-oriented Kodiaq RS, initially launched with a twin-turbocharged 2.0 TDI diesel producing 240 horsepower (later replaced by a 245 horsepower 2.0 TSI gasoline engine), featured sportier styling, unique interior appointments, and chassis enhancements. The first-generation Kodiaq was internationally successful, particularly in European and Asian markets, establishing Škoda as a credible competitor in the growing mid-size SUV segment by offering exceptional practicality, solid engineering, and value pricing compared to many competitors."

    description: "The second-generation Škoda Kodiaq, unveiled in 2023 for the 2024 model year, builds upon the successful formula of its predecessor while introducing more advanced technology, electrified powertrains, and a refined design language. Continuing on an updated version of the Volkswagen Group's MQB platform, the new Kodiaq maintains similar dimensions to the outgoing model at approximately 4.76 meters in length, but with improved interior packaging to enhance passenger and cargo space. Available in both five and seven-seat configurations, the second-generation Kodiaq features evolutionary exterior styling with a more upright front end, redesigned LED headlights with the option of innovative 'Matrix LED' technology, and a new rear light design incorporating Škoda's updated C-shaped signature. Engine options include traditional gasoline and diesel powertrains alongside a new plug-in hybrid variant combining a 1.5 TSI gasoline engine with an electric motor and a 25.7kWh battery, providing an electric-only range of approximately 100 kilometers (62 miles) and the ability to fast-charge at up to 50kW DC—addressing one of the limitations of earlier PHEV systems. Conventional powertrains include 1.5 TSI and 2.0 TSI gasoline engines and 2.0 TDI diesel options, with power outputs ranging from 150 to 204 horsepower in standard models, while the performance-oriented RS variant offers 265 horsepower. All versions feature some form of electrification, with mild hybrid systems standard on the 1.5 TSI engines. The interior represents a significant advancement with a new design featuring a 10-inch digital instrument display (upgradable to 13 inches), a 13-inch central infotainment touchscreen, and a new 'Smart Dials' concept that combines physical controls with built-in digital displays to improve usability while driving. Material quality has been enhanced throughout, with a focus on sustainable options including seat coverings made from recycled materials. The 'Simply Clever' features that Škoda is known for have expanded to include innovations like smartphone-controlled parking via the MyŠkoda app, sleep packages for passenger comfort on long journeys, and enhanced storage solutions throughout the cabin. Advanced driver assistance systems have been comprehensively updated to include travel assist, which combines adaptive cruise control and lane keeping for semi-autonomous driving on highways. The second-generation Kodiaq aims to build on the commercial success of its predecessor while addressing the market shift toward electrification and enhanced technology, maintaining Škoda's reputation for offering exceptional practicality and value in a more sophisticated and future-focused package."
